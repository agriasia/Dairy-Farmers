      <section id="main_content">
        <p>India is the largest producer and consumer of the dairy milk in this world generating around 130 million tonnes and the overall globe production estimates 730 million tones. FAO estimated 85 % of all milk worldwide was produced from cows and the rest is from other species (11 % Buffalo,2 % came across and 2 % others.). U.S.A is the second largest producer of milk and the initially largest producer of cow's milk. Israel dairy farms are really productive with a return of 12,546 kgs of milk each cow annually.</p>

<p>Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Farmers">Dairy Farmers</a> are in situation with enhanced expense of manufacturing as well as non remunerative prices. Return on investment for dairy farmers are quite less because of increased prices of feed and also medical costs for animals. Previously, the livestocks used to depend on grazing, natural deposits and crop deposit for fodder which are lowering now. The milk farmers are forcibly depend upon the packaged livestocks feed to enhance the milk production, eventually the price of manufacturing has actually raised. Feed cost has been increasing around 30- 50 percent from previous 4 successive years, but the milk purchase costs have actually not increased relatively. Health care also large concern, vaccination and also De-warming expenses have actually been enhanced.</p>

<p>The productivity of the livestocks is based upon the caring and handling, farmers are gradually lowering their non performance pets as well as changing over to reliable types like Jacket as well as Holstein Friesian. Financial investment on these unique cattle is heavy problem for the farmers and these types require more feed, water as well as caring because they are foreign animals. Farmers are battling to obtain financings for milking animals and the bank charges are extremely high as much as 12 % rate of interest and insurance policy cost is additional. With the boosted expense of manufacturing including expensive types the dairy farming is not remunerative, so the farmers are gradually decreasing their herd dimension as well as a few of the farmers have quiting the milk farming.</p>

<p>The procurement rates have actually not raised relatively with milk market offering prices, as a matter of fact the procurement costs have actually lowered in Oct and Nov months of 2012. The Andhra Pradesh farmers have encountered a bitter experience called "MILK HOLIDAY" due to the untrue market evaluation by milk advertising firms. They have actually imported inexpensive Skim milk powder by approximating that the milk manufacturing is going to be less for this year however there is a constant growth in milk manufacturing. The majority of the milk marketing business including Co-operative markets have actually minimized the procurement prices as well as a few of them have quit to accumulate the milk from farmers. Animal fodder is the biggest problem for the farmers, decrease in grazing land, natural deposits and dry spell situations leads bumpy ride for pet fodder. Last year, the dry forage was cost Rs.2.00 per kg in some dry districts of Andhra Pradesh. The loan centers for cattle are too tough for small farmers, a country poor lady who wishes to purchase a buffalo she hears the financing with high rate of interest up to 14 % with an excellent battle, where as in the cities the vehicle loan hear authorized with 7-8 percent rates of interest with no obstacles.</p>

<p>Our Indian Dairy Sector remains in disorderly situation, India is the biggest milk producer on the planet, actually ...</p>

<p>whereas chemical blended faulty milk is extensively offered on the market.</p>

<p>whereas milk consumption is very less as well as 68.72 Kg/capita/year.</p>

<p>Whereas The Food as well as safety standards authority of India (FSSAI) has revealed the 68 % of the mass milk products have located to be unsafe and second-rate high quality.</p>

<p>Indian government has opened evictions to FDI's and thrilled to go into in open market contracts, already France's DANONE is aggressively marketing it's dairy products in Indian market connected with Dynamix Dairy products- Baramathi (Maharashtra), New Zealand's FONTERRA and DANONE are interested to get significant pile in Hyderabad based Tirumala Milk products. As we know that all largest milk generating nations are interested to go into in Indian market, the majority of the developed nations' milk farming is enormously moneyed as well as greatly subsidized by the federal governments with different revenue support strategies like i.e. Milk income loss contract settlement, Market loss help, Dairy products Revenue loss help programs, dairy products Compensation, milk advertising and marketing charges and more. Such massive subsidies maintain the International milk costs down which are going to affect quite terribly on our Indian milk market. we should resist as strong as possible to safeguard our Indian dairy products Industry against dumping.</p>
